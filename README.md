A simple command-line tool that analyzes DNA sequences. It can compute nucleotide counts, GC content, transcription to RNA, complements, and reverse complements.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- `matplotlib` for optional plotting

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage
Run the main script and follow the prompts to enter or load a DNA sequence. After the analysis is displayed, you can choose to view a bar chart of nucleotide composition.

```bash
python main.py
```
